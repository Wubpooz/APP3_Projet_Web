            <p> Welcome to Nyxen, where beauty meets sustainability. Our journey began with three best friends who shared a passion for skincare and a deep concern for the environment. Ava, Maya, and Liam came together with a shared vision: to create a skincare brand that not only delivers effective results but also upholds the values of clean beauty and eco-consciousness. </p>

            <p> Our story starts during our college days, where we often found ourselves discussing the harmful chemicals prevalent in mainstream skincare products and their negative impact on both our bodies and the planet. Driven by a desire to make a change, we embarked on a mission to create something better. </p>
